///                   to BMI Scale and its main purpose is to show the BMI scale. 
///                   The form only shows the BMI scale.
///                 - The main menu strip now shows a single item titled, "Help," 
///                   and the form to view the BMI scale can be accessed there
///  * 2019-07-26: Added internal documentation
///                Adjusted the size BMI Scale form so it's the same size as the main
///                   form.
///
